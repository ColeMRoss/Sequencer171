# SlimyWorld
How to play:
The player starts off with only 1 food eaten while the ai start off with a random amount of food eaten. If a slimes food is higher than the players it will devour the player if it gets to close. The player is also able to eat slimes with less food than they have. Slimes that dont have horns(They only spawn as pink slimes.) can be eaten by any slime no matter the size. To win the player must be the last slime(With horns) left standing.
